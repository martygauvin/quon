# About QuON #

QuON is a generic platform for the automatic collection, collation, and summarisation of survey data using computers and hand-held mobile devices.

The project was initially funded by the [Australian National Data Service (ANDS)](http://www.ands.org.au/). The version available from this Website is the version developed from the ANDS grant. For information on an updated version, please contact [quon@newcastle.edu.au](mailto:quon@newcastle.edu.au).

QuON is an open source survey system allowing researchers to design and implement surveys, free of royalty and data quantity or privacy issues. Originally designed for management of surveys relevant to health behaviour, QuON can be employed to conduct surveys on almost any topic. The software provides user-friendly survey definition and deployment modules for construction and implementation of surveys. In addition QuON supports collection of metadata relating to the survey, and publication of the survey metadata on the [Research Data Australia (RDA) website](http://services.ands.org.au/), managed by the [Australian National Data Service (ANDS)](http://www.ands.org.au/).
